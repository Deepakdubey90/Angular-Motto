    <!--
        Using the controller as syntax means that we get a variable per controller.
        This helps aid in nested controller calls because it means that we can avoid
        any $parent calls.
    -->
    <div ng-controller="MainCtrl as main">
        {{main.someObject}}

        <!--
            This is an example for increasing performance in newer versions of Angular (v1.3.0-beta.10+).
            Use the one time binding syntax '::' when it makes sense. This is because binding once removes the
            $$watchers count after the undefined variable becomes resolved. This frees up resource and improves
            the speed of the digest loop.
